# How to Get Unbanned on Unturned (2025 Guide) 🚀

Getting banned from Unturned can feel like a total nightmare, especially if you swear you were just minding your own zombie-slaying business. Whether it’s a case of mistaken identity or an oops on your part, this friendly guide will walk you through what to do if you’ve been banned and how to appeal it so you can get back to crafting, surviving, and causing mild chaos.

## Maybe You Are HWID Banned? 🖥️

Did your ban sneak up on you right after you made a fresh new account, or does it shadow you no matter how many accounts you make? You might be **HWID banned** (Hardware ID Ban)! That’s Unturned telling your PC hardware “Nope, no playtime today,” even if you try to start clean.

## Step 1: Understand Why You Were Banned ❓

Check your email or any Unturned/Steam notifications carefully. Typical reasons for bans include:
- Using cheats, hacks, or third-party mods that give unfair advantages  
- Toxic or griefing behavior that ruins the fun for others  
- Sharing accounts or suspicious activities like trading exploits

**Pro tip:** Brush up on the Unturned and Steam rules before appealing—it helps!
